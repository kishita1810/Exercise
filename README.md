# Exercise
## Exe 1: Performance Test
- The approx limit (loop-rate) at which desired rate does not coincide with real life for 4 combinations are:
- C++ Publisher with Python Subscriber : 328
- C++ Publisher with C++ Subcriber : 120
- Python Publisher with Python Subcriber : 30
- Python Publisher with C++ Subscriber :37
## Exe 2: Using C++ capture images from webcam and apply canny edge filter
- I had very little experience of C++ coding and thus I tried to write the code but due to some technical glitches or wrong setup I was not able to build and run the project.
- However, I was able to successfully implement the task using python.
-  Video of output using Python:

## Exe 3: Classifier capable of determining the class of the X-ray image
- I had no prior knowledge of Deep Learning or Machine Learning but still using various references and the solution provided I was able to implement till Data pre-processing.
- I have shared the link to Google Colab Notebook which I used to implement the task.
